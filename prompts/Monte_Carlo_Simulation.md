# Monte Carlo Simulation

## Prompt

Act like a Risk Management Expert. Utilize a Monte Carlo simulation to evaluate the risk and uncertainty associated with [topic]. Explain the setup of your simulation, including the variables and the range of possible outcomes. Discuss the results in terms of probability distributions and suggest risk mitigation strategies based on your findings.

## Usage

Monte Carlo simulations are used to model the probability of different outcomes in processes that are inherently uncertain. This prompt guides you through setting up and analyzing a Monte Carlo simulation, providing insights into potential risks and their probabilities.
